# sudoku-solver
A logic based command line Sudoku solver. Example input files are given in `input.txt` and `input_evil.txt`. 
No brute forcing is used, hence not all Sudokus can be solved. That isn't to say that this code includes all 
possible logical deductions.

## Usage
``` python3 solver.py <inputfile> ```

## TODO
- Improve logic as required
- Degeneralise: allow non 9x9 grids
- Jigsawdoku?
- Allow brute force capability (to be switched on/off) such that all puzzles can be solved
